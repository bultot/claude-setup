## Overview

This project decouples Claude Code from a local machine by running it on a dedicated Proxmox LXC container. The container is always on, persistent, and accessible from any device through multiple access paths. No more losing sessions when you close your laptop.

**The problem:** Claude Code sessions are tied to your terminal. Close the lid, lose the session. Switch devices, start over.

**The solution:** Run Claude Code on a headless server with tmux for session persistence. Access it from anywhere via SSH (MacBook), Happy Coder (iPhone/Mac), or Mosh (unreliable networks).

## Architecture

```
Proxmox Host (beelink)
└── LXC 200: claude-code (Ubuntu 24.04, 4c/8GB/32GB)
    ├── Claude Code 2.1.37 (Max subscription)
    ├── Happy Coder 0.13.0 (session relay)
    ├── tmux 3.4 (session persistence, mobile-friendly)
    ├── Tailscale (100.103.193.111, SSH enabled)
    ├── Node.js 22.22.0
    ├── 1Password CLI (service account, CC Shared Credentials vault)
    ├── MCP servers (Firecrawl, Home Assistant, Google Workspace, Salesforce)
    ├── Plugins (superpowers, episodic-memory, context7, github, + 18 more)
    └── 10 Git repos (~/projects/personal/)

Access paths:
  MacBook → ssh cc           → Tailscale → tmux → Claude Code
  MacBook → ssh cc-raw       → Tailscale → plain shell
  iPhone  → Happy Coder app  → relay → LXC
  iPhone  → Blink Shell/Mosh → Tailscale → LXC
```

## Features

- **Always-on Claude Code** — runs on a Proxmox LXC, survives reboots (`onboot: 1`)
- **Session persistence** — tmux keeps sessions alive across disconnects
- **Multi-device access** — MacBook, iPhone, browser — all hit the same session
- **One-command access** — `ssh cc` from MacBook drops straight into tmux
- **Happy Coder relay** — interact with Claude Code from your phone
- **Tailscale networking** — encrypted P2P mesh, no port forwarding needed
- **Idempotent scripts** — every script is safe to run multiple times
- **Phased migration** — 8 independent phases, each with snapshots for rollback

## Prerequisites

- [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/) host with LXC support
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) account with Tailscale installed on your devices
- Claude [Max subscription](https://claude.ai/) (all usage goes through Max, not API tokens)
- macOS with zsh (for MacBook thin-client setup)

## Getting Started

The setup is split into phases. Each phase has its own script and creates a Proxmox snapshot for easy rollback.

### Phase 1: Create the LXC Container

Run **on the Proxmox host**:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-lxc.sh
```

This creates an unprivileged Ubuntu 24.04 LXC with:
- 4 cores, 8 GB RAM, 32 GB disk
- Tailscale TUN device pre-configured
- Nesting enabled (for Docker compatibility)
- Auto-start on boot

After success, snapshot:

```bash
pct snapshot 200 phase1-lxc-created
```

### Phase 6: Configure MacBook as Thin Client

Run **on your MacBook**:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-macbook.sh
```

This installs SSH config and shell aliases for instant VPS access. See [Usage](#usage) for the full command reference.

> Phases 2–5 and 7–8 are documented in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and will be added as the project progresses.

## Usage

After running `setup-macbook.sh` and sourcing your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Quick Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `cc` | SSH into default tmux session on VPS |
| `cc-sessions` | List all active tmux sessions on VPS |
| `cc-project <name>` | Attach/create a named project session |
| `cc-claude [dir]` | Start Claude Code (optionally in a project dir) |
| `cc-happy [dir]` | Start Happy Coder for phone relay |

### Examples

```bash
# Jump into your main session
cc

# Work on a specific project
cc-project my-api

# Start Claude Code in a project
cc-claude my-api

# Start Happy Coder so you can continue from your phone
cc-happy my-api

# Check what's running
cc-sessions
```

### Session Lifecycle

1. Start a session from MacBook: `cc` or `cc-project myproject`
2. Close the lid — session stays alive on the VPS
3. Reopen and reconnect: same command, same session
4. Switch to iPhone via Happy Coder — same Claude Code session
5. Come back to MacBook — `cc` picks up right where you left off

## Configuration

### LXC Container (ID 200)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Hostname | `claude-code` |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04 |
| Cores | 4 |
| Memory | 8192 MB |
| Disk | 32 GB (local-lvm) |
| Network | DHCP on vmbr0 |
| Features | nesting=1, keyctl=1 |
| TUN device | Mounted for Tailscale |
| Auto-start | Yes |

### SSH Hosts

| Host | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cc` | Auto-attaches to tmux `main` session |
| `cc-raw` | Plain SSH for scripting, scp, rsync |

Both resolve `claude-code` via Tailscale DNS.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full 8-phase migration plan:

- [x] **Phase 1** — Create LXC container on Proxmox
- [x] **Phase 2** — Provision base packages (Node.js 22, Tailscale, tmux, gh)
- [x] **Phase 3** — Create user and shell configuration
- [x] **Phase 4** — Install Claude Code and Happy Coder
- [x] **Phase 5** — Migrate Git repos, Claude config, MCP servers, 1Password
- [x] **Phase 6** — Configure MacBook as thin client (SSH config done)
- [ ] **Phase 7** — Configure iPhone access
- [ ] **Phase 8** — Cutover and cleanup
