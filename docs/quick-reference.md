# CC Remote Workspace — Quick Reference

> Daily commands, iPhone setup, and troubleshooting for your always-on Claude Code environment.

## MacBook Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cc` | SSH into default Zellij session on LXC |
| `cc-sessions` | List all active Zellij sessions |
| `cc-project <name>` | Zellij session + cd to project on LXC |
| `cc-claude [name]` | Claude Code on LXC (auto-finds project under `~/projects/`) |
| `cc-happy [name]` | Happy Coder on LXC (auto-finds project under `~/projects/`) |

## On the LXC (inside a session)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claude` | Start Claude Code (auto-wraps in Zellij) |
| `happy` | Start Happy Coder (auto-wraps in Zellij) |
| `sessions` | List all Zellij and Happy Coder sessions |
| `zellij list-sessions` | List raw Zellij sessions |
| `zellij attach <name>` | Attach to a specific session |

## Zellij Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl-p` | **Pane mode** — split, move, resize, close |
| `Ctrl-t` | **Tab mode** — new, rename, switch, close |
| `Ctrl-s` | **Scroll mode** — search, scroll through output |
| `Ctrl-o` | **Session manager** — switch between sessions |
| `Ctrl-q` | **Quit** — session stays alive for reattach |
| `Alt-d` | Detach from session |
| `Alt-n` | New pane |
| `Alt-1/2/3` | Switch to tab 1, 2, or 3 |

**Clipboard**: Select text with mouse → auto-copied to MacBook clipboard via OSC 52.

## Session Lifecycle

```
1. Start from MacBook       →  cc  (or cc-project myapi)
2. Close the lid            →  session stays alive on LXC
3. Reopen MacBook           →  cc  (same session, right where you left off)
4. Switch to iPhone         →  Happy Coder app
5. Back to MacBook          →  cc  (picks up again)
```

## iPhone Setup: Happy Coder

Happy Coder lets you interact with Claude Code sessions from your phone through a relay.

### Install

1. Install **Happy Coder** from the App Store:
   https://apps.apple.com/app/happy-coder/id6748571505

### Persistent Relay (auto-starts on boot)

Happy Coder runs as a systemd user service on the LXC, so it's always available:

```bash
# Check service status
ssh cc-raw "systemctl --user status happy-coder"

# View QR code for initial pairing (or after LXC reboot)
ssh -t cc-raw "screen -r happy-relay"
# Scan QR code with phone, then Ctrl-A D to detach
```

The relay runs in a persistent screen session (`happy-relay`). Once paired, your phone stays connected — no re-scanning needed unless the LXC reboots.

### Manual Sessions (per-project)

You can also start project-specific Happy Coder sessions:
```bash
cc-happy my-api        # from MacBook
```

### Daily Use

- Open Happy Coder on iPhone — the always-on relay shows automatically
- Tap a session to interact with Claude Code
- Start per-project sessions from MacBook (`cc-happy <project>`) for focused work
- Sessions persist even when the app is closed

### Web Access (from any browser)

- Open https://app.happy.engineering
- Connect to your running `happy` session on the LXC

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" or "Host not found"

```bash
# Check Tailscale is connected
tailscale status

# Verify LXC is reachable
ping claude-code
```

If Tailscale is down on iPhone, open the Tailscale app and reconnect.

### Session lost after reboot

Zellij sessions survive SSH disconnects but not LXC reboots. After a reboot:
```bash
cc                    # creates a new session automatically
```

To check if old sessions exist:
```bash
cc-sessions
```

### Claude Code authentication expired

SSH into the LXC and re-authenticate:
```bash
ssh cc-raw
claude login
```
Follow the browser link to re-authenticate with your Max subscription.

### Happy Coder not showing sessions

1. Make sure `happy` is running on the LXC:
   ```bash
   cc-happy
   ```
2. Re-pair if needed — the QR code refreshes each time you start `happy`
3. Check that your phone and LXC are both on Tailscale

### Syncthing config sync broken

If a Claude Code update overwrites symlinks:
```bash
~/.claude-shared/restore-symlinks.sh
```

### LXC not starting after Proxmox reboot

On the Proxmox host:
```bash
ssh beelink
pct status 200          # check status
pct start 200           # start if stopped
pct list                # verify onboot flag
```

## Architecture Reference

```
Proxmox Host (beelink)
└── LXC 200: claude-code (Ubuntu 24.04, 4c/8GB/32GB)
    ├── Claude Code (Max subscription)
    ├── Happy Coder (session relay for phone/web)
    ├── Zellij (session persistence + terminal multiplexer)
    ├── Tailscale (100.103.193.111)

Access Paths:
  MacBook  → ssh cc (Ghostty)  → Tailscale → Zellij → Claude Code
  iPhone   → Happy Coder app   → relay     → Claude Code
  Browser  → app.happy.engineering → relay  → Claude Code
```
